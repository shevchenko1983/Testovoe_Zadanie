Add high conversion Stripe checkout forms to your WordPress site and start accepting payments in minutes.

== Description ==

In a few simple steps you can add Stripe's beautiful checkout forms to your WordPress site. Stripe's forms are continually tested and optimized to maximize customer conversion.

**What is Stripe Checkout?**

*"Stripe Checkout is an embeddable payment form for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. It works within your siteâ€”customers can pay instantly, without being redirected away to complete the transaction."*

If accepting credit card payments quickly and painlessly with little setup time is what you're looking for, this plugin is for you.

WP Simple Pay is not designed to integrate with more complex shopping cart, form builder or membership site plugins. Many of those plugins already have their own Stripe integrations.

This is a standalone Stripe checkout plugin.

That's it. **No other plugins required.**
